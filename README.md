# Vagrant-General
<p>Vagrant File for General porpouses. It can be used as example for small servers and webapp DevOs.</p>
<h2>INTRODUCTION:</h2>
<p>The file is based on CentOS7 because I believe is more reliable than Ubuntu. I like the Debian family but the virtualization and the servers are more stronger in RedHat family.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>From CLI run this command:</p>
<pre>
<code>
$git clone https://github.com/Heribertosgp/Vagrant-General.git
$cd Vagrant-General
$vagrant up
</code>
</pre>
<p>Now you are up and running</p>
<h3>VAGRANTFILE CONFIGURATION:</h3>
<p>In order to use HAproxy and NGINX I will use a multiple-Machine configuration to distribute the traffic among several machines.</p>
<h3>SERVICES:</h3>
<p>To install the services I use a inline SHELL provisioning to keep the things as simple as posible. With YUM repositorie and restarting two services: "Puppet and NGNIX".
To configure the services I used Puppet. (Or I will, it's not done yet)
The services installed are HAProxy, NGINX, PHP-FPM, REDIS (not yet), MYSQL.
Some details on the configuration of the services:
